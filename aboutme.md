You might be wondering: what's this technologically-inept humanities major doing in CSCI 103? Well, it starts with the classic tale of the beauty of a liberal arts education--otherwise known as Williams' godforsaken divisional requirements. I was always intimidated by computer science, but it seems so ubiquitous in the world now that my lack of knowledge in this area felt almost like a disservice to myself. I'm realizing that computer science is a lot more than just the super mechanical, monotonous image of it I always had in my head. It's not just about the technical speak and logic puzzles--computer science actually allows you to create really exciting, original things, and Electronic Textiles feels like the epitome of that. And so even though I initially pre-registered for this class mostly for the Div-III requirement, I'm really glad to be here and excited for the opportunity to create in a new way.
