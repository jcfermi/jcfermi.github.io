Our assignment was to make a circuit that lights up an LED when two homemade switches are closed. My first switch is a paperclip that functions as an exclamation point for Williams, that becomes closed when it touches the satin stitched conductive thread. My second switch is a felt with a conductive thread patch attatched, which becomes closed when it touches another satin stitched conductive thread.

Tip: Make sure that the threads in the back are not loose or touching.
