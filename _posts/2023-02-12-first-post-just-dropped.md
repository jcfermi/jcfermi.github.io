I'm Jeana, class of 2025. I'm from New Jersey, which I think counts as a boring fact.


Today, I think I'll major in Russian. Tomorrow, who knows?


Here's my experience coming into this class:

| Sewing Experience | Programming Experience | Passion |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| None | None | Literally so much |


I'm excited to learn to sew. A little less excited to learn the programming, but I welcome the challenge (and the student help hours I'll probably have to frequent. I hope I build the intellectual resilience for all the debugging we'll have to do, and that I'll ultimately be able to make wearable technology I find cool (I've already talked this up to my friends too much not to).
