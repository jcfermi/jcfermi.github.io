# name, year, majors, sewing, programming, learning hops, boring fact.

I'm Jeana, class of 2025. I think I'll major in Russian, although I make up a new answer for this every time I'm asked. 


Here's a table about my experience coming into this class:

| Sewing Experience | Programming Experience | Passion |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| None | None | Incalculable |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
