I'm Jeana, class of 2025. I think I'll major in Russian, although I make up a new answer for this every time I'm asked. 


Here's my experience coming into this class:

| Sewing Experience | Programming Experience | Passion |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| None | None | Literally so much |

A boring fact about me is that I'm from New Jersey.
